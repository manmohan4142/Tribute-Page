        Millions of Indians found great inspiration in<b> Dr APJ Abdul Kalam</b>, widely known as the Missile Man of India.

          and was widely referred to as 'People's President'.Kalam's contributions to the nation's scientific advancements
          are still acknowledged seven years after his passing. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his
          work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.He also played a pivotal organisational,
           technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear
           test by India in 1974.Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling
            Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's
            President",he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a
            recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.
